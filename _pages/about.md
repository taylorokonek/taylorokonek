Welcome to my personal website! I'm a fourth year Ph.D. student in the [Department of Biostatistics](http://www.biostat.washington.edu/)  at the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/), advised by [Jon Wakefield](http://faculty.washington.edu/jonno/). My research interests include spatial statistics, small area estimation, and statistical methods for use in official statistics and complex survey data settings. I am particularly interested in applications related to HIV prevalence estimation and disease mapping, and much of my dissertation work is thusly focused.

I currently work as a research assistant under the supervision of my dissertation advisor. Our work focuses on spatio-temporal methods for under-5 mortality estimation and HIV prevalence estimation, primarily in sub-Saharan Africa. We are currently developing methodology for benchmarking subnational estimates to national level estimates. This work is particularly important in the realm of official statistics, where a certain level of agreement between national level estimates and subnational estimates is often required. 

I have a keen interest in statistics education, and am an active participant in the Statistics Education Reading Group, jointly run by graduate students in the Statistics and Biostatistics departments at UW. I have also had the opportunity to serve as a student mentor through the Statistics department's [Directed Reading Program](https://spa-drp.github.io/), as well as with the [Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center's](https://www.fredhutch.org/en.html) [Pathways Undergraduate Research Program](https://www.fredhutch.org/en/about/internships/pathways-undergraduate-researchers.html). 

I completed my B.A. in Mathematics and Religion (separate degrees, there is no degree in both Math and Religion that I'm aware of), with a concentration in Statistics at St. Olaf College in Northfield, MN. I grew up on Madeline Island, WI, and in St. Paul, MN, and in my spare time I enjoy rock climbing, knitting, cooking, hiking, and reading.
